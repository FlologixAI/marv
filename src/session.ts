// The headless Marv session: everything that turns the agent loop (runAgent, src/agent.ts) into Marv, with no
// UI. It holds the conversation (what the model sees), builds the system prompt and tool list once per
// conversation, waits for MCP servers, compacts when the context is nearly full, starts subagents, records
// trajectories, saves the session, and hands each turn back as a stream of events. The TUI (src/app.tsx) is one
// client of it; the SDK (src/sdk.ts) gives it to other programs.
//
// One turn at a time: send() while a turn runs throws. The history is only appended to (compaction is the one
// exception), and the system prompt and tool specs stay the same objects for a whole conversation: that's what
// keeps the provider's prompt cache hitting (see CLAUDE.md, "Prompt cache").
