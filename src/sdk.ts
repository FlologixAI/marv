// sessions and trajectories, driven by your code. createSession() reads nothing from disk unless asked
// (`sources`), and without an `approve` callback only what yolo mode vouches for runs (reading, edits outside .git,
// sandboxed commands without network); anything else goes back to the model as refused. Bun only, for now.
