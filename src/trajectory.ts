// Trajectories: a record of what every agent run did, for measuring Marv over
// time (which model, prompt or tool change made runs better) and, later, for
// training data. One append-only JSONL file per session:
//
//   ~/.marv/trajectories/<project>/<session id>.jsonl
//
// Each line is one record (see TrajectoryRecord), stamped with the format
// version, the time and the session. A turn is one user message and
// everything the agents did until they stopped; subagents' records carry
// their own agent id and point to the turn they ran in. Feedback (explicit
// labels and implicit signals from the user's next message) is appended as
// it comes, pointing back to its turn.
//
// Separate from sessions (src/sessions.ts) on purpose: a session is the
// latest state, rewritten after every turn, for resuming; a trajectory is the
// history, only ever appended to, with timings, approvals and subagents'
// steps that a session never had. Private (0600): it holds code and prompts.
