// features containers use (namespaces), without a container runtime.
//
// Inside it:
//   - the whole system is visible but read-only;
//   - the home folder is replaced by an empty one, so secrets there (~/.ssh,
//     ~/.marv with the API key, browser profiles, …) can't be read, except a
//     few toolchain folders (bun, cargo, git config…), mounted read-only, with
//     the credential files inside them hidden (tokens inside whole config
//     files, like ~/.gitconfig or ~/.cargo/config.toml, can't be);
//   - the project folder is the only writable place (plus a private /tmp); a
//     caller may add folders that are visible read-only, e.g. a worktree's .git;
//   - bun's download cache is a throwaway one in that private /tmp (RAM-backed),
//     gone when the command ends: a shared or host cache would let one sandboxed
//     command (e.g. an install's lifecycle scripts) plant packages for another
//     context;
//   - there's no network unless the command asked for it;
//   - the environment starts empty, so API keys can't leak into commands.
// Approval decides *whether* a command runs; the sandbox limits *what an
// approved command can touch*.
