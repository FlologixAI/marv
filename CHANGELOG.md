# Changelog

All notable changes to Marv are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and Marv uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While it's below 1.0.0, a minor version (0.**x**.0) may contain breaking changes; a patch version (0.1.**x**) never does.

What counts as Marv's public API: the SDK (`@flologixai/marv/sdk`), the `marv` command's flags and slash commands, and the files it reads (`~/.marv/config.json`, `.marv/skills/`, `.marv/agents/`, `.mcp.json`, `AGENTS.md`, saved sessions).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- After the model changes files in a TypeScript project, Marv runs the project's typecheck (in the sandbox, read-only) and tells the model about errors its changes added, anywhere in the project, so it fixes the callers it broke before saying it's done. `/diagnostics on|off`, config `diagnostics`, SDK option `diagnostics` (on by default). Needs the sandbox, a `tsconfig.json` in the folder Marv starts in, and the project's own `typescript` (or tsgo) in that folder's `node_modules` (a global tsc isn't used). The SDK also exports the `CheckResult` and `TsError` types.
- SDK: `maxSteps` sets how many steps a turn runs before it stops (without `approve`) or asks whether to keep going (default 25).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Security

- The sandbox no longer exposes the host's `/run`. It had been mounted read-only, but a read-only mount doesn't stop a process from connecting to the sockets in it. A sandboxed command (which runs without asking in yolo mode, the default) could reach the user's D-Bus session and start programs outside the sandbox with `systemd-run --user`, and could reach the GPG and SSH agents, the keyring, the display and docker's socket. `/run` is now an empty folder in the sandbox. Only the folders on `PATH` and the DNS config that live there are shown again, read-only. Affects 0.1.0 and 0.1.1: update with `npm i -g @flologixai/marv@latest`.

### Changed

- The system prompt always explains how to set up an MCP server (where the config goes, its format, and that `~/.marv` isn't reachable from the sandbox), so the model hands you a correct config instead of inventing keys.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- README: on Windows, use WSL (the npm page shows the README of the version published).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06

The first public release, on npm as `@flologixai/marv`.

### Added

- A full-screen terminal UI with streaming Markdown replies, mouse-wheel scrolling, drag-to-copy and a `/` command menu.
- An agent loop with tools: `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`, `edit_file`, `write_file`, `bash`, `web_fetch`, `memory`, `skill` and `agent`. It asks before continuing past 25 steps, retries an empty reply, and never runs a tool call cut off at the output limit.
- `edit_file` matches forgivingly (trailing whitespace, indentation), keeps CRLF line endings, and shows the closest lines when nothing matches. `edit_file` and `write_file` say when a change breaks the file's syntax.
- Providers: OpenRouter (any tool-capable model) and Ollama (local models), with a model picker and `/think`.
- A bubblewrap sandbox for commands on Linux, and yolo mode (on by default): sandboxed commands and edits in the project run without asking; everything else shows a diff or the command first.
- `web_fetch`: web pages as Markdown, and GitHub repositories, folders and files through GitHub's API.
- MCP servers (stdio and Streamable HTTP) in Claude Code's `.mcp.json` format; a project's servers start only once trusted (`/mcp trust`).
- Skills (`.marv/skills/`), subagents with Claude Code-compatible agent types (`.marv/agents/`), optionally in their own git worktree, and memory across sessions.
- Saved sessions (`marv -c`, `marv -r`, `/resume`), automatic and `/compact` compaction, and token and cost tracking (`/cost`).
- Trajectory logs with feedback (`/good`, `/bad`, `/label`) and `bun run stats`.
- The SDK: `createSession()` from `@flologixai/marv/sdk` runs Marv from code, without the UI.
- Evals: `bun run eval` runs real models on small tasks with hidden checks.
