// from Marv's own node_modules. Not symlinked: the sandbox hides the home folder such a link would point into (and
// `dereference` copies a package that is itself a link, as with Bun's isolated linker, as files). The launcher is
// `#!/usr/bin/env node`, so the sandbox needs a system node (/usr/bin/node here; one under the home folder, e.g. nvm,
// is hidden).
